I'll update the PHP file to display the information entered in the HTML form. This will show the user what they submitted after successful form processing.

// code

```

## What's Changed in the PHP File

I've made these key updates to the PHP processor:

1. **Added HTML Output**: Instead of just processing the data and redirecting, the file now generates a complete HTML page to display the submitted information.

2. **New Variables**:
   - Added `$formSubmitted` to track if the form was actually submitted
   - Created a function `getSubjectText()` to convert subject codes to readable text

3. **Display Organization**:
   - Success message when form passes validation
   - Error messages when validation fails
   - Formatted display of all submitted form fields
   - A back button to return to the form

4. **Removed Redirection**:
   - No longer redirects back to the form with a status parameter
   - Instead shows all information on the processor page itself

5. **Styling**:
   - Added CSS to style the confirmation page
   - Created distinct sections for the form data display
   - Added visual styling for success and error messages

## How to Use It

1. Replace your existing `process.php` file with this new version
2. Submit the form from your HTML page
3. The PHP page will now display all submitted information instead of redirecting

This approach gives users immediate confirmation of what they submitted and is helpful for debugging or demonstration purposes.

For a production environment, you might want to:
- Add the email sending functionality back in
- Consider storing the data in a database
- Implement a more robust session-based message system

Would you like me to explain any other aspects of form handling or make additional modifications to the code?
