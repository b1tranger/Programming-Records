#include <stdio.h>

int main() 
{

    char lineINPUT[30]; //this is an array
  fgets(lineINPUT, sizeof(lineINPUT), stdin); //function for string
  
  //the scanf() function has some limitations: it considers space (whitespace, tabs, etc) as a terminating character, which means that it can only display a single word (even if you type many words). That's why, when working with strings, we often use the fgets() function instead of scanf() to read a line of text. Note that you must include the following arguments: the name of the string variable, sizeof(string_name), and stdin:
    printf("Hello, World!\n%s\n", lineINPUT);
    /* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT */    
    return 0;
}
