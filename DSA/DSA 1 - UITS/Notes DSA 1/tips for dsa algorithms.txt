- first get a visual explanation (not the codes)
- then see the codes and try to relate with the visual explanation
- you will need to memorise the algorithms eventually, so don't bother about it


figured it out after getting fked in the labtest 1

----------------------------------------------------------

after final labtest realizations (didn't go well):


make a topic list > ask gpt for code > see algorithm (book) > write code on codeblocks

GPT is the way to go. (not for cheating)
Memorization is gay.
Practice makes perfect.
