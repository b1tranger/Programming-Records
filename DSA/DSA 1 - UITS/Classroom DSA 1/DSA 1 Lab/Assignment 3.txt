Dear Students,

You are assigned a programming task focusing on queue-based data structures. You are required to solve three problems using arrays in C++, and submit a corresponding Zoom video tutorial for each solution.
You must solve the following:

Dequeue Implementation Using Array
Implement a double-ended queue (deque) in a simplified and efficient manner using arrays.

Priority Queue in Ascending/Descending Order
Build a priority queue using an array. Your implementation should support either ascending or descending order, based on your choice.

Priority Queue with Associated Values
Implement a priority queue using arrays, where each element has an associated priority value. Ensure correct ordering based on the priority.

Video Tutorial Requirements
For each problem, you must create a video tutorial using Zoom that demonstrates and explains your code.

Video Recording Guidelines:
Use Zoom to record your screen and your face (camera must be ON).
Share your code editor and console output while explaining your solution.
Your explanation must include:
Overview of your approach
Key logic behind the implementation
Demonstration of the code in action

Time Limit:
Video should be no longer than 10 minutes.

Submit one video explaining all problems.

File Naming Convention:
Save each video in MP4 format.

Name each file as follows:
YourName_ID_Section.mp4
(Example: Gaus_12345_3B2.mp4)


Ensure videos are clear, complete, and not corrupted.

Academic Integrity
Each student must complete and submit their own work.
Plagiarism in any form (code or video) will result in strict disciplinary action.
If you encounter any issues or need clarification, feel free to reach out during office hours or on the class forum.
